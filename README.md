# covid-happiness_score

During the [visualization](https://github.com/amrukwa/data_viz) performed for COVID-19 datasets, I decided to check whether there is some correlation between the [Happiness Score](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) and its components and the pandemic severity. As it seemed to produce some really interesting outcomes, I deepen the analysis.

## The datasets
[Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
